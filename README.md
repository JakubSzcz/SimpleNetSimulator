# Simple Net Simulator
It is a simple network simulator, based on a static routing protocol, where you can create any topology with basic Routers and Links. You can address routers ports with a IPv4 address and check the connectivity with a simple implementation of ICMP ping protocol.  The core of application was created in a Java and GUI was made in Swing. Application was written for the purpose of my studies project in collaboration with @markwyp. 

### How to run:
* Make sure you have installed the latest version of Java
* Download binary files from release section and unpack them
* Run cmd and go to the directory where the files were put
* Use command **java GUI/Forms/NetworkGUI** to run the application
